# CASHFLOW
Create a web application called cashflow to determine which home will yield and its cashflow.


# ABSTRACT

With a booming real estate market, more than 50% of transactions are investment homes. However, investors have a hard time figuring if a house in the market will have positive cash flow. Even if a price seems low, taxes, HOA, age of home, location can take most of the rental income.
The web application determines which home will yield  and cashflow after paying all the miscellanous fees in addition to investment.
