# IDEA 1: Music Recommendation System
1. Introduction to the problem statement:
        We aim to develop a music recommendation system based on the music played history of the user. We will be determining the best algorithm to serve this need of recommending songs depending on genre, artist, language, composer, lyricist, and other related attributes. Other than that we will also be developing an application that could play those recommended songs.

2. Abstract (rough draft):
        Music recommendation system deals with recommending music based on the user’s taste of music. This type of system is important as the market is flooded with different types of music and it is almost impossible for users to listen to each music and select one that they like. Hence, this system deals with saving time of users by efficiently recommending new songs depending on their taste.The system will also play songs which user selects and recommend related songs and provide an option to play those as well.

3. Approach
        We will be using django framework for backend development, react for frontend, and collaborative filtering algorithm  for song recommendation

4. Persona: 
        Users who listen to music and want to explore new songs without having the trouble to manually look for them.

# IDEA 2: Face Mask Detection 
1. Introduction to the problem statement: 
        A key strategy in the early stage of disease progression is the use of masks and protective equipment to limit the virus spread. Multiple countries implemented the use of masks as a control strategy. Computer Vision systems can be used to greatly facilitate the implementation of mask detection on human faces/Masked face recognition.

2. Abstract:
        Today it has become mandatory for all citizens to wear a face mask to protect themselves from COVID-19. This application can be helpful for all the shop owners, offices, banks, or any public place because if anyone is not wearing a mask then he or she must not be allowed in that area. So, to take care of this problem we don’t need any guard or person who keeps a watch on people. We can integrate a camera that continuously clicks pictures of humans and detect from their faces whether they are wearing a face mask or not. A Masked Face Recognition approach is based on a multi-granularity masked face recognition model to achieve 95% accuracy on a masked face image dataset.
The application will show the impact of not wearing a mask and directs you to a video that shows how to wear a mask in the right way. Finally detects if you are wearing the mask the right way.


3. Approach:  
        We will be using Python script and implementing OpenCV, Keras, TensorFlow frameworks. We will be using React JS as frontend and Python in the backend

4. Persona: 
        Images of people with and without masks.

# IDEA 3: Job recommendation system 
1. Introduction to the problem statement
        Looking for jobs has become a virtual experience in today’s competitive market and why there are hundreds of online job sites that all promise to land their dream job to the user. However, this is not as easy for the millions of people that are job hunting. One example is the thousands of recently graduated students that are trying to join the workforce who have difficulty landing a job that they are suitable for and that they will enjoy. A tremendous factor to this issue is due to their lack of experience and knowledge of how to hunt for a job. Our proposed idea aims to tackle this issue by simply recommending the user for jobs in which match their skills from data collected from job sites and machine learning. 

2. Abstract (rough draft)
        Nowadays, the market is flooded with jobs due to which either applicants miss out on relevant jobs for them or companies do not receive relevant applicants for the positions. So to tackle this problem we are planning to implement a job recommender that would produce a score for each job depending on the skill set's similarity and will filter out relevant jobs from the pool. 

3. Approach 
        We will be scraping skill data from LinkedIn and skill data for jobs will be scraped from indeed. Both data will be matched to show user jobs suitable for their skill sets. We will be using a cosine or Jaccard similarity algorithm to handle the issue of matching skills of user and job. Other than that we will be using React for the front end and Django for backend development.

4. Persona 
        Since recent graduates or entry-level professionals often lack job experience they would greatly benefit from our system since it matches them to jobs based on their skill sets. Nonetheless, even people that have years of experience can use it to find a job that is more aligned with their future interests.

# IDEA 4: Housing recommendation system
1. Introduction to the problem statement
        Finding a house based on an individual’s preferences and been a challenging task these days. It is much harder to find suitable housing localities in a state like California, where the prices are 2.5 times higher than the median national home. So, we as a team are looking forward to building a model that can give out the information about the suitable housing localities that a user can go for, based on the user’s input preferences.

2. Abstract (rough draft)
        California is one of the most developed states in the United States. It is home to many billion-dollar industries like Hollywood and other tech giants situated in Silicon Valley and Silicon beach. As per the 2019 census, the median California home is nearly 2.5 times higher than the median national home. So, based on the 1990 census data provided by Pace Ronald Barry and R. Kelley, we are going to build a model that provides users with a suitable locality or area, based on the user’s budget and preferences.

3. Approach
        We will be implementing machine learning techniques using python to build and train our model. We will be using javascript for the frontend.

4. Persona: 
        First-time home buyers would benefit from our app as they can plan out where to look for a home that’s within their budget and their needs. 
Real state agents can similarly benefit as they would be able to get a better insight into the housing market in California.
